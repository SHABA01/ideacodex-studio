# IdeaCodex Studio (Test Variant)

IdeaCodex Studio is an experimental test variant of the IdeaCodex App.

This repository represents a re-architected, mode-driven reasoning engine
built on a unified Studio canvas. Instead of multiple standalone tools,
IdeaCodex Studio introduces configurable cognitive "modes" that operate
within a single application interface.

---

## Purpose

This project is a structural and architectural experiment designed to:

- Consolidate multiple AI tools into a unified mode system
- Centralize token governance and cost controls
- Reduce infrastructure overhead
- Enable rapid feature expansion without separate deployments

This is NOT the production IdeaCodex App.
It is a sandbox and architectural testbed.
